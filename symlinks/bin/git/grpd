# TODO: this script should capture output and search for branches via the following format:
#
# error: The branch 'GEOD-304' is not fully merged.
# If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D GEOD-304'.
# error: The branch 'GEOD-321-make-map-expand' is not fully merged.
# If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D GEOD-321-make-map-expand'.
#
# Successfully deleted branches look like this:
#
# Deleted branch GEOD-341-about-backbone-in-master (was c64d0f9).
#
# It would be nice if it looked like this:
#
# Deleted branches:
# - GEOD-341-about-backbone-in-master
# - GEOD-342-some-test-branch
#
# Stale branches:
# - git branch -D GEOD-304
# - git branch -D GEOD-321-make-map-expand
#
