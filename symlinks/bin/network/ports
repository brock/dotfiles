# shows you a count of clients connected - should be the same on web servers. once this is less than 100, you can assume that this is out of the load balancer
# netstat -an | grep :80 | wc -l 

# fast check to see if a port is in use, but not always as helpful finding the source:
# nc -z localhost 80

# Scan a long range of ports quickly
# nc -z localhost 1-10000
